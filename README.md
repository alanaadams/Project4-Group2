Idea 7: Predicting Housing Prices Problem: Build a regression model to predict housing prices based on
various features such as location, size, amenities, etc. This will assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in
making informed decisions.
Datasets/APIs:
1. House Sales in King County, USA Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
2. Python Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/
3. Python Scikit-learn: https://scikit-learn.org/
Project Details:
1. Load and preprocess the housing dataset using Pandas, including data cleaning, handling missing
values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, random forest regressor, or gradient boosting
regressor) using Scikit-learn on the training data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root
mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared.
5. Develop a web application using HTML/CSS/Bootstrap and JavaScript to allow users to input property
details and obtain price predictions.
6. Deploy the trained model as a REST API using Flask or Django and integrate it into the web application.
7. Utilize JavaScript Plotly or Python Matplotlib to create visualizations that showcase housing price
trends, important features, and prediction accuracy.
